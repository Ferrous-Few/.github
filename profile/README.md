# ‚≠ê Ferrous Few ‚úä

Oldschool Runescape Clan

This is the official home for public resources and special projects we'll be working on for OSRS, Discord, WOM, new stuff will be added soon.

## üëã Greetings, fellow Ironmen!
Join us in Ferrous Few to stand alone, together! We want to provide a home for all iron players out there. And although our clan mainly consists of regular ironman, there's also a good number of UIMs and HCs and GIMs. We have members of all levels and skill sets, so whether you're just starting out on a fresh Ironman account, or you're an experienced player looking to do raiding; you'll be able to find a friend to do it with here.

## ‚úÖ Requirements:
There are no level requirements to join, but you must be an ironman to be accepted into the CC.  Non-irons are welcome to guest in the CC.

Respectful and positive attitude, we all enjoy banter and humor but you need to understand your audience.  This is a friendly and social CC, and being a toxic member will lead to you being removed.

## üíª How to Join:
You can join our CC in game by going to the double smiley tab, and then the green double smileys.  Then type in 'Ferrous Few', and you will now be a guest in the Clan.  After that, you can coordinate with any Silver Key rank for applying and joining our Clan.  It only takes about a minute.

For our Discord invite link, any high ranking person in the CC should be able to get an invite link to you.

Alternatively, you can message me directly on Discord and I'll send you an invite link to your discord and help you with any questions about our clan.

We look forward to meeting you ‚ù§Ô∏è
